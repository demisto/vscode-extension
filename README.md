You can also use the *XSOAR: Install/Update Demisto-SDK* command.  

Commands:

* *XSOAR: Load integration/Script*: Loads an integration or a script to the UI.
* *XSOAR: Demisto-SDK Validate/Lint*: Run linters and validators on opened file directory.
* *XSOAR: Demisto-SDK Update Release Notes*: Update release notes of the opened file's pack.
* You can also run the commands directry from the explorer menu:

## Configurations  


### Demisto-SDK Path

The default behavior of the extension when running a demisto-sdk command is to run `demisto-sdk <command>`. You can set a different demisto-sdk path (if you want to run always on the same demisto-sdk or when you're using a tool like pipx). You can set the `xsoar.demisto-sdk.Path` to the demisto-sdk executable.

### Auto Linters

The Cortex XSOAR extension will automatically use the demisto-sdk to lint (code files) and validate (.yml files) your packs.

To turn on auto-linters in your workspace, set the `xsoar.autoFindProblems.readProblems` setting to `true`.
To control the auto-lints behaviour:  

* `xsoar.linter.[linter-name].enable`: Whether to enable the auto-lint.

* `xsoar.linter.[linter-name].patterns`: Which file patterns (glob) to run with the linter.

The linters will write its data to the path configured in `xsoar.autoFindProblems.reportPath`, which is also the file that VSCode takes the problems from.

If you wish to see the process running (or check why it's failing or not working), change `xsoar.linter.showOnSaveTerminal` to `true`.

### Auto Save  

By default, the extension will automatically save changes made to the integration/automation file made in the webview (opened with *XSOAR: Load Integration/Script*).
to disable it, change `xsoar.autoSave` to `false`.
