# Change Log

## [Unreleased]

- The **xsoar.autoFindProblems.readProblems** setting defaults to ***false*** which prevents the log file from appearing in each workspace opened.
- The **xsoar.demisto-sdk.pythonPath** is now deprecated.  
    Please use the **xsoar.demisto-sdk.Path** setting. The default behavior is to run all commands with `demisto-sdk <command>`. You may set the demisto-sdk executable with the given setting and use tools such as pipx.  
    Alternatively, you may also use it with your python executable of choice (`<python-path> -m demisto_sdk` as an example.)
